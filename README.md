<--- I am a computer science student. Going to graduate in the coming months, I am eager to secure challenging roles in Software Development.
In the second year of my degree, I undertook a 10-days coding challenge at CodeChef and become 2 star coder. I was delighted to be presented with the opportunity to utilise the skills gained during my studies to solve problems in the engineering world.
My studies have provided me with broad proficiency in the use of coding languages, tools, software packages and techniques. As such, I am confident that I can make an instant impact in engineering roles.
I am eager to hear about potential career opportunities, so I would be pleased to chat about job openings in the engineering sphere.
My key skills include: Competitive programming, Web Development, Machine Learning, engineering design, mathematics. --->
